**Practical Class 1, Week 1: Welcome to the World of Code with Scratch**
------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Duration: 120 minutes**

### **Introduction (10 minutes)**

**What is Programming?**
------------------------

Imagine you're directing a movie. You need to tell the actors where to stand, what to say, and how to move. Programming is similar - you give instructions to a computer, telling it what to do, step-by-step. Today, we'll use Scratch, a visual programming language, to create our own interactive stories and games.

-   **Real-World Scenario**

Think about creating your own animated music video or designing a game where you control the characters. With programming, you can bring your ideas to life!

### **Exploring the Scratch Interface (20 minutes)**

-   **The Stage:** This is where your creations come alive. It's like the screen of your computer.

-   **Sprites:** These are the characters or objects in your project. You can choose from the library or create your own.

-   **Blocks Palette:** This is where you find all the instructions you can give to your sprites. They're like LEGO blocks - you snap them together to create your code.

-   **Scripts Area:** This is where you build your code by dragging and dropping blocks.

### **Basic Blocks & Animations (30 minutes)**

-   **Motion Blocks:**
    -   `move 10 steps`: Makes your sprite move forward.
    -   `turn 15 degrees`: Rotates your sprite.
    -   `go to x: 0 y: 0`: Places your sprite at a specific location on the stage.
-   **Looks Blocks:**
    -   `say "Hello!" for 2 seconds`: Makes your sprite display a message.
    -   `switch costume to`: Changes the sprite's appearance.
    -   `change color effect by 25`: Alters the sprite's color.
-   **Sound Blocks:**
    -   `play sound`: Plays a sound effect.
    -   `start sound`: Starts playing a background music loop
-   **Hands-on Practice:**
    -   Make a sprite move across the stage.
    -   Have a sprite say "Hello!" when clicked
    -   Create a simple animation where a sprite changes costumes repeatedly.

### **Mini-Project: Animated Story or Dance (30 minutes)**

-   **Instructions**:
    -   Choose a sprite or create your own
    -   Use motion, looks, and sound blocks to tell a short story or create a dance sequence.
    -   Be creative and have fun!
-   **Tips:**
    -   Plan your story or dance beforehand.
    -   Break down the animation into smaller steps.
    -   Experiment with different blocks and combinations.

### **Wrap-up & Further Learning (30 minutes)**

-   **Recap**: Review the key concepts covered in the class.
-   **Q&A**: Address any questions the students have.
-   **Preview of Next Class**: Briefly introduce what will be covered in the next practical class, building excitement for the next step in their programming journey.

**Remember**:

-   Keep it fun and engaging!
-   Encourage experimentation and creativity
-   Offer help and guidance when needed.
-   Celebrate the students' accomplishments, no matter how small!
