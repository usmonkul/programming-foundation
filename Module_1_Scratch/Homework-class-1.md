## **Homework: Scratch Practice & Exploration**

### **Objectives:**

- Reinforce understanding of basic Scratch blocks and concepts
- Encourage experimentation and creativity
- Build confidence in using Scratch independently

### **Tasks:**

1. **Revisit and Enhance**: Go back to the mini-projects you created in class (the dancing sprite, the interactive story, etc.). Add more details, animations, or interactions. Try to make them even more interesting and fun!
2. **Scratch Challenge**: Choose one of the following challenges and create a Scratch project:
    - **Interactive Greeting Card:** Design a digital greeting card that plays a song, shows an animation, or lets the user interact with it.
    - **Simple Catch Game:** Create a game where a sprite moves across the screen and the user tries to click on it to "catch" it. Keep score and make it progressively harder!
    - **Animated Storyteller**: Use different sprites and backgrounds to tell a short story. Include dialogue, sound effects, and creative animations.
3. **Explore & Learn**:
    - Visit the Scratch website and check out the "Tutorials" section.
    - Try out a few tutorials that catch your eye.
    - Explore the "Explore" section to see amazing projects created by other Scratchers. Get inspired!

### **Tips & Tricks:**

- **Don't be afraid to experiment!** Scratch is all about trying things out and seeing what works.
- **Break down your projects into smaller steps.** This makes them easier to manage and helps you stay organized.
- **Use comments** to explain your code. This will help you understand it later and make it easier for others to follow along.
- **Get creative!** There are no limits to what you can create with Scratch. Let your imagination run wild!
- **If you get stuck**, don't hesitate to ask for help from your teacher, classmates, or online resources.

### **Vocabulary:**

- **Sprite**: A character or object in your Scratch project
- **Stage**: The background or area where your project happens.
- **Scripts Area**: The place where you build your code using blocks
- **Blocks Palette**: The collection of all the different instruction blocks you can use
- **Motion Blocks**: Blocks that control movement
- **Looks Blocks**: Blocks that change the appearance of sprites
- **Sound Blocks**: Blocks for adding sounds and music

Remember, the more you practice, the better you'll become at Scratch and programming in general! Have fun and happy coding!
